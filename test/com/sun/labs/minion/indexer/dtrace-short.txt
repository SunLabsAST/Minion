Dan,

Regarding the incorporation of Dtrace capabilities within Containers,
I wanted to get a "pulse" on current and near-term support for this in
current/planned Solaris 10 updates (unless only Nevada will handle this
capabilty, which was not my prior understanding).  Any details / URL's
explaining the capabilites would also be helpfull.

Please let me know as I have a major Telco interested in using these 
capabilities asap.

Thanks,

Hey Bob,

It's just this:

Until we produce a formalized policy (a few weeks), please do
one of the following:

   1)   Add "-target=1.5" to your javac build lines.
   2)   Use Java 5 (any update) to build with.

Brendan - I'd like to try these out:

http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/resource/helper-monkey-0.10.tar.gz

I'm running nevada b53 at the minute with Firefox 2.0 installed by 
default. So I grabbed an old tarball of Firefox 1.5.0.4, unpacked it and 
was able to bring up firefox-bin 1.5.0.4.
http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.4/contrib/solaris_tar_ball/firefox-1.5.0.4.en-US.solaris2.10-i386.tar.bz2

I then setup the LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to this 
unpacked tarball dir and fired up firefox-bin. I could then run dtrace 
-l javascript*:::* and list out the probes, but firefox failed to display.

Any ideas?

Hmm, I tried the same and also had firefox-bin hang on startup -- and yet
running the system shipped build of firefox 1.5.0.4 worked fine. I
thought it may have been a path issue, but I haven't yet found the fix.

However, if you are on b53 then you may have firefox 2.0, which I just
ran with that version of HelperMonkey. So far it seems to be working fine.
I used the following while in the directory with libmozjs.so:

   $ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/firefox/libmozz.so:./libmozjs.so
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/mps:/usr/lib/firefox  
   $ export MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/firefox/plugins
   $ /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin -UILocale C -contentLocale c

Hopefully that will be happier.

I suspect firefox 1.5.0.4 was hanging while trying to do the auto update,
so another workaround may be to skip that (somehow)...

cheers,

Brendan

Brendan - no joy :(

Did exactly as you suggested below on nevada b53 using version 0.10 of 
helper monkey and still getting a hang:

$ uname -a
SunOS jmrlaptop 5.11 snv_53 i86pc i386 i86pc

Without setting up the exports:
$ /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin -UILocale C -contentLocale c --> Firefox 
2.0 launches fine

Setting up exports:
$ cd~/helper-monkey-0.10/lib
$ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/firefox/libmozz.so:./libmozjs.so
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/mps:/usr/lib/firefox 
$ export MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib/firefox/plugins
$ /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin -UILocale C -contentLocale c --> Firefox 
2.0 hangs

Any ideas?

I believe Zones were designed to prevent this.  You might be able to do
it anyway if you can get the dtrace_kernel privilege, but I'm not sure
if that's possible in a zone, and if it is it certainly isn't the
default.

Assuming we lack access to the fds structure, what would an alternative be?  I ask because I'm using an implementation of dtrace on Mac OS X, which seems to be a mostly complete port with a few missing pieces.

I'm comfortable building and maintaining my own fds structure, populating it with the path argument to open that precedes reads and writes on the fd.  This approach has been met with some success.  However, open accepts relative paths, meaning sometimes the file name will not be useful.

I tried to bypass this by using the cwd of the accessing process, but even this was often incomplete!  Is there any way around this?

Ian,
You'll find fewer "missing pieces" in the next Mac OS X Leopard Seed  
Release (I take it you're a registered Apple developer eligible for  
seeding.) And you'll find fewer yet in the GM Leopard. The challenge  
in constructing a full path from a DTrace action comes when you try to  
traverse vnodes -- that usually requires taking a lock.

Thanks for the response.

I'm unclear about the vnode traversal complication.  Is this something I would face if I was limiting my scope to file names for files opened, read or written by any given user process?

Arun:

Not sure if this is what you are asking. In DTrace you subscribe
for probes and wait for these probes to fire. So the script will run
until you stop it (or call exit() from within). So to terminate a script
just hit ^c.

Hopefully this answered what you wanted?

I actually understood this a bit differently: I think Arun wants to measure 
the delay between someone pressing return on a commandline and the program 
actually "running".
There's a few things that come to mind:
- you need to monitor the user's shell to catch the 'return'
- you need to define what constitutes a "running" program (probably not as 
easy as it sounds).
