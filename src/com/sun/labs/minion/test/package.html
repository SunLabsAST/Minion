        Provides test classes and utilities for indexing and querying.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This package contains a set of test utilities.  Many of the classes
        in here are of limited use, but QueryTest allows for detailed
        inspection of an index, and IndexTest provides indexing code.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        IndexTest can be used to index a list of documents into an index.  A
        configuration file controls the attributes of the engine used.  Files
        are read and indexed verbatim.
    </p>

    <p>
        QueryTest allows for queries, in any supported grammar, to be issued
        against an index.  Saved fields can be displayed as results.  It also
        has a large number of commands that exercise different parts of the
        engine.
