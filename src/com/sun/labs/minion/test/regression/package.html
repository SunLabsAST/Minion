  <body>
      Provides the classes that generates the entries and queries for
      the regression test.

      <p>
      	The <code>TestEntrySelector</code> selects entries from the
	index to be used in queries.
	The <code>TestFieldEntrySelector</code> selects field entries
	from the index to be used in queries related to fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>QueryFactory</code> takes the entries selected from by
	the <code>TestEntrySelector</code> and 
	<code>TestFieldEntrySelector</code> to create queries for the
	regression test.
      </p>

      <p>
      Currently, the regression test targets are in the build.xml
      file. This test is based on the javadocs for JDK 1.4.2. To run
      the test, you must first build the index from the javadocs by
      typing:
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>ant index_javadocs</code>
      </p>
      in this directory. Then to create the queries, type:
      <p>
      <code>ant create_queries</code>
      </p>
      <p>
      in this directory. The created queries will be saved in a text
      file called queries.txt in this directory. Please refer to the
      documentation in the QueryFactory class for the types of queries
      that are being generated.
      </p>
      <p>
      To run the generated queries against the search engine, type:
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>ant run_queries</code>
      </p>

      <p>
      All the classes relating to Tuples are not being used at this point.
      They were intended to figure out how many documents a certain
      query will return. If we know that, we can tailor our query choices for
      the regression test to include queries that will return a small,
      medium, and large number of documents. However, since it will take a 
      long time to compute the number of documents returned for 
      all possible queries, the Tuples stuff is not used at this moment.
