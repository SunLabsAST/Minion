    <h2>Query Operators</h2>
    <h3>Term Operators</h3>
    <p>
      There are a number of operators that affect how and what terms
      are retrieved from the index for a term in the query.  These
      operators may be applied to a term in any order, and their
      effect is cumulative.
    </p>
    <h4><tt>&lt;morph&gt;</tt></h4>
    <p>
      Inidicates that the engine should consider all known
      morphological variants for the term when retrieving terms from
      the index.  This is the default term operator in the standard
      engine configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the query:

    <blockquote><tt>&lt;morph&gt; dog</tt></blockquote>

    will retrieve documents containing the terms <em>dog</em>,
    <em>dogs</em>, <em>dogging</em> and <em>dogged</em>.
  </p>
    
    <h4><tt>&lt;exact&gt;</tt></h4>
    <p>
      When the &lt;exact&gt; operator is applied to a term, the
      engine will only retrieve that exact form of the term from
      the index.  For example, the query:

    <blockquote><tt>&lt;exact&gt; dog</tt></blockquote>

    will
    only retrieve documents containing the term <em>dog</em>.
    It will not retrieve documents that contain variants of
    the term such as <em>dogs</em>, <em>dogging</em> and
    <em>dogged</em>.
  </p>
    
    <h4><tt>&lt;stem&gt;</tt></h4>
    <p>
      The <tt>&lt;stem&gt;</tt> operator inidicates that the engine
      should use a language-independent stemming algorithm to retreive
      terms from the index that are related to the query term.  For
      example, the query:
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><tt>&lt;exact&gt; dog</tt></blockquote>

    <h4><tt>&lt;case&gt;</tt></h4>
    <h4><tt>&lt;wild&gt;</tt></h4>
    
    <h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
    <h4>And</h4>
    <p>
      The &lt;and&gt; operator is used to select a set of documents that
      contain all of the operands for this operator.  Each of the operands
      may be a
