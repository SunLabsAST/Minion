    <title>The <code>com.sun.labs.minion.util.buffer</code> package</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with readable and
      writeable buffers of data.  While these buffers are similar in
      some respects to the buffers found in the <code>java.nio</code>
      package, they differ in a few significant ways:

      <ul>
        <li>
          There are separate interfaces for writeable buffers and
          readable buffers.  This separation expresses the distinction
          between indexing time requirements (writeable buffers) and
          query time requirements (readable buffers).
        </li>

        <li>
          These buffers provide methods for encoding integers and
          longs that use either a specific number of bytes or the
          minimal number of bytes using a 7 bit encoding scheme.
        </li>

        <li>
          There is no way to provide integer or other "views" onto
          these buffers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The package provides several implementations of the basic
        buffer interfaces.  Each implementation is useful in a
        particular situation.  The documentation for each
        implementation describes the situation in which it should be
        used.
      </p>

      <p>
        The buffers allow the encoding and decoding of integers using
        a 7-bit encoding.  In this encoding, the 7 lower-order bits of
        a byte are used to encode the integer.  If the 8th bit is 0,
        then there are no further bytes in this number.  If the 8th
        bit is one, then the next byte continues the number.  Note
        that this means that a number that would completly fill a 32
        bit integer will take 5 bytes to encode.  The expectation is
        that we will use a variety of techniques to ensure that this
        doesn't occur.
