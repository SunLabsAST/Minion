    Description:
        A stub configuration for our mailindexer that makes dumping synchronous,
        which makes testing easier.
-->

<config>
    <!-- We're going to use a synchronous dumper so that when an entry is
    indexed, when control is returned to the caller the data is available for
    searching. -->
    <property name="dumper" value="sync_dumper"/>
    
</config>
