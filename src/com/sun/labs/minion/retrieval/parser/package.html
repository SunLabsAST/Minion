  </head>

  <body>
      Provides the query parsers available in Minion.

      <p>
          This package contains the JJTree/JavaCC files that generate the
          parsers for Minions available grammars.  For each grammar file (.jjt)
          there is also a Transformer class that transforms the tree output
          from JJTree into a tree of Minion operators by using the corresponding
          ElementFactory class.  Most of the classes in this package are
          generated by JavaCC.
