  <body>
      Provides the query evaluation capabilities for Minion.

      <p>
          This package provides the internal representations of the query
          operators used to evaulate queries such as {@link com.sun.labs.minion.retrieval.PAnd}, 
          {@link com.sun.labs.minion.retrieval.Not},
          and {@link com.sun.labs.minion.retrieval.Weight}, as well as some classes closely related to them
          such as those that perform weighting and the classes that hold
          groups of results such as {@link com.sun.labs.minion.retrieval.ArrayGroup} and
          {@link com.sun.labs.minion.retrieval.ScoredGroup}.
      </p>

      <p>
          Sub-packages of this package contain other pieces of the retrieval
          system such as the various parsers and the classes that translate
          parsed queries into the above query operator objects.
