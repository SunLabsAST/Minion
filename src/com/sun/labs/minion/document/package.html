Provides some basic document analysis for different types of text documents.

<p>

The document package contains analyzers for marked up text.  These analyzers
are invoked if a matching type of text is encountered.  For example, if an
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.IndexableString} that's type is set to
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.IndexableString.Type#HTML} is passed into the engine,
the {@link com.sun.labs.minion.document.MarkUpAnalyzer_html} will automatically be used to
recognize certain fields and automatically index those fields separately.
