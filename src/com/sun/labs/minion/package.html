Provides the API for interacting with the Minion Search Engine.

<p>

This package includes all the core classes and interfaces that are used
to interact with the Minion Search Engine.  The key classes to be aware
of are the {@link com.sun.labs.minion.SearchEngineFactory},
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.SearchEngine}, and as an alternative the 
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.SimpleIndexer}.  The SearchEngine provides
the basic capabilities of indexing and retrieval with the help of a few
data wrapper classes.  These include ways of feeding data into Minion
such as the {@link com.sun.labs.minion.IndexableFile} and the {@link
com.sun.labs.minion.IndexableMap}, and the classes used to view results from
searches within Minion such as {@link com.sun.labs.minion.ResultSet} and
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.Result}.  SimpleIndexer provides an interface that
is easy to get started with for feeding data into the engine.  Classes are also
provided to aid in performing highlighting of results, and to allow a simple
property-based meta data store internal to the index among others.
