            Classes for providing programattic querying.  These classes provide a way to run
            queries without having to embed queries written in one of the Minion query languages.
        </p>

        <p>
            This can make things a lot easier in a number of instances.  For example, if
            you want to find fields whose value is equal to a value provided by a user, then
            you can use the programattic API to build a query like:
        </p>

        <pre>
        String value = ...;
        StringRelation r = new StringRelation("title", Relation.Operator.EQUALS, value);
        ResultSet rs = engine.search(r);
        </pre>

        <p>
            If you're trying to use the query language to do the same thing, then you need
            to beware of values that have single or double quotes in them, since these will
            need to be escaped before they can be passed to the query parser.
