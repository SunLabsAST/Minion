      Provides the classes for building a pipeline.  A pipeline
      consists of <code>Stage</code>s that are connected together in
      order to provide processing of data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The pipelines that are built using stages are <em>push</em>
      pipelines.  By that we mean that data is pushed from "upstream"
      stages to "downstream" stages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally speaking, pipelines must be built in reverse order,
      since upstream stages are passed their downstream stages as
      arguments to their constructors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data that are passed down a pipeline are defined by the
      <code>DocumentEvent</code> class.  Note, however that we don't
      actually create and pass down instances of this object.  Rather,
      we pass along the components of these objects, in order to avoid
      the object creation overhead.
