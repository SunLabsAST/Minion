Provides document clustering functionality.

<p>
This package contains the classes for performing results clustering.  Not
to be confused with feature clustering, results clustering will take a set
of documents that are the results of a query and attempt to group them into
N conceptually different groups.  This form of clustering may be used on any
result set.
