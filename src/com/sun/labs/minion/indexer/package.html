    <title>The <code>indexer</code> package</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      Provides classes that do the main work of indexing: building the
      term and document dictionaries and the postings file.

      <p>
	The main driver in this package is the
	<code>FieldIndexStage</code> which is the <code>Stage</code>
	in the indexing pipeline that is responsible for processing
	the tokens that come down the pipeline.  The
	<code>FieldIndexStage</code> adds tokens to the term
	dictionary, document names to the document dictionary and term
	occurrences to the postings file.  The
	<code>FieldIndexStage</code> is also responsible for building
	the static summaries of the documents, and putting document
	titles into the document dictionary.
      </p>

      <p>
	The <code>FieldIndexStage</code> is given a number of
	megabytes that it can use to store postings data.  When this
	limit is reached or passed, the currently stored data is
	dumped to a partition.  This dump always occurs at the end of
	a file, so that a file is not spread across more than one
	partition.
      </p>

      <p>
	A partition is made up of four different files, each with it's
	own structure and it's own class for reading/operating on the
	files.
