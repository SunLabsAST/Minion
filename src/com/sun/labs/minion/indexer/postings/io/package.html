postings information.

The main interfaces are {@link com.sun.labs.minion.indexer.postings.io.PostingsOutput}
(for writing postings) and {@link com.sun.labs.minion.indexer.postings.io.PostingsInput}
(for reading postings).  The package includes a few implementations of these
interfaces.  Each implementation is intended for particular uses in the system.
The documentation for each class will indicate under which circumstances it
should be used.
