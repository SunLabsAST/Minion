Provides the automatic document classification functionality in Minion.

<p>

This package contains the code that implements the classification
infrastructure in Minion.  The package contains implementations of classifiers
as well as the implementation of the classifier infrastructure.  Two
classifiers are currently provided: {@link com.sun.labs.minion.classification.Rocchio} and
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.classification.BalancedWinnow}.  Training classifiers is broken
down into several steps.

<ol>
<li>Feature Clustering<br>
Feature Clustering determines which features (aka terms, or usually words)
should be combined together as if they were a single feature.  This package
contains a few different {@link com.sun.labs.minion.classification.FeatureClusterer}s, each
implementing a different strategy for performing clustering.  Only one should
be used at a time for a particular index.</li>
<li>Feature Selection<br>
Feature Selection is the process of determining the top N features that can
be used to best differentiate documents that will be in the class from
documents that don't fit into the class.  Feature Selection is actually 
performed on Feature Clusters, although single-feature based selection may
be chosen by using the supertype
{@link com.sun.labs.minion.classification.ContingencyFeatureClusterer}, which provides
single-feature clusters.</li>
<li>Training<br>
Training is the process of building the actual classifier.  Using the selected
feature clusters from the above step, one of the classification algorithms (as
defined in the configuration file) is invoked on the training set to build
the classifier.</li>
</ol>

The above process may actually be repeated many times if cross-fold validation
and "feature backoff" are defined for use in the configuration file.
<p>
Once classifiers are trained, they are automatically evaluated across sets
of documents as future documents are indexed to disk.  Classifiers cannot be
run against documents that have already be indexed.  If classifiers are added
or changed, the documents to be classified should be re-indexed.
<p>
Following the "Everything Is Dictionaries And
Postings" mantra, the classification package defines two new partition types
that are used for storing classifiers and feature clusters.  The infrastructure
for these classes is included in this package.  The {@link
com.sun.labs.minion.classification.ClassifierManager} handles the partitions used for
storing trained classifiers, and the {@link
com.sun.labs.minion.classification.ClusterManager} handles the partitions used for storing
generated feature clusters.
