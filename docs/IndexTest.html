  <title>The IndexTest program</title>

  <body>
    
<p>
      The <code>IndexTest</code> program can be used to index a list
      of files or URLs or to recursively index a directory
      structure.  Currently, we can index html and plain text
      documents.
    </p>


    
<h1>Options</h1>


    
<p>
      The <code>IndexTest<code> program takes a number of options:
    </code></code></p>


    
<table border="1">

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th width="15%">Argument</th>
          <th width="85%">Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>-i <em>&lt;stuff&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            This option is required.  The value of this option should
            be the name of a file containing a list of files.  Each
            file in the list should appear on a separate line.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <!-- one of (TD TH) -->
          <td>-d <em>&lt;dir&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            This option is required.  The value of this option
            specifies the directory where the index will be placed.
            If the directory does not exist, it will be created.  If
            the directory contains an existing index, that index
            will be added to.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>-x <em>&lt;XML configuration file&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            Specifies an XML&nbsp; file to be used as the basis
            for the properties given to the indexer.  This may be an
            easier way to specify options. Details of the contents of this file are given in the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc/edu/cmu/sphinx/util/props/doc-files/ConfigurationManagement.html">Configuration Management for Sphinx-4</a> web page.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <!-- one of (TD TH) -->
          <td>-e <em>&lt;entry type&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            This option specifies the type of entry that should be
            used in the main dictionary while indexing.  The value of
            the entry is the name of the class to use for the entries.
            The default value is
            <code>com.sun.labs.minion.indexer.entry.CasedDFOEntry</code>.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <!-- one of (TD TH) -->
          <td>-n <em>&lt;number&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            This option specifies the number of threads to use during
            indexing.  Generally, using more threads will increase the
            indexing speed, although this appears to not be the case
            at the current time (locking problem?).  The default value
            is 1.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <!-- one of (TD TH) -->
          <td>-m <em>&lt;number&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            Specifies the amount of memory (in megabytes) to use to
            store index data before dumping a partition into the
            index.  The default value is 64.  Using a higher number
            will mean that you should provide more heap space to your
            JVM.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <!-- one of (TD TH) -->
          <td>-k <em>&lt;directory&gt;</em></td>
          <td>
            The directory where lock files will be placed.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    
</table>


    
<h1>Operation</h1>


    
<p>
      As <code>IndexTest</code> is running, you will see progress
      messages printed out, indicating how much text has been
      indexed and how fast it has been indexed.  You will also see
      messages about partitions that have been dumped into the index
      as well as merges of smaller partitions into larger ones.
    </p>


    
<p>
      You may run the <a href="QueryTest.html"><code>QueryTest</code></a> program at
      any time during the indexing run to query the index being
      built.
    </p>
