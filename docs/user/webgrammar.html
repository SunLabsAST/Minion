Web Grammar
</div>

<div class="mainDoc">
Minion offers several grammars that may be used to interact with the
search engine.  The "Web" grammar seeks to imitate the query language
that has become a de-facto standard across web search engines.  The Web
grammar is not capable of using all the query features of the search
engine, but it provides a simple set of operators that users will
understand implicitly if they've used an "advanced search" feature of a
web search engine.  This grammar could be improved to add other features
of web query languages that are not yet present.<p>

<div class="subHeader">Behavior</div>
The default behavior of the Web grammar supports the basic retrieval
mechanism of Minion -- the relaxation ranking passage retrieval
algorithm described in the <a href="operators.html#pand">PAND</a>
operator documentation.  Terms entered without any markup will be
treated as a passage during retrieval.<p>

It is possible to modify the default behavior by changing the default
operator.  The default may be changed to a basic weighted boolean AND,
or a weighted boolean OR, but that is not recommended.<p>

All terms provided to the web query language will be passed through
Minion's <a href="operators.html#morphexp">morphological variants</a>
engine.<p>

<div class="subHeader">Syntax</div>
The syntax of the web grammar is fairly simple.  Operators are generally
designated by a prefix character attached to a term.  Quotes and
brackets are special characters as described below.  As the parser for
the grammar is generated automatically, it is fairly strict about these
characters.  Open quotation marks and brackets must be matched by close
quotation marks and brackets.  Nesting is not supported, and it is up to
the user (aka the developer) to ensure that only proper queries are
issue, or to report errors from the not particularly friendly parser.<p>

<div class="mainHeader">Or</div>
To specify that a term be included as part of an <a
href="operators.html#or">OR</a> (that is, that the term be optional),
prefix the term with a "/" character.<p>

<span class="query">surf /web</span><br>
This query finds documents that contain the term "surf" and ranks those
that also contain the term "web" generally higher than those that
don't."<p>

<div class="mainHeader">Not</div>
To specify that a term be <a href="operators.html#not">excluded</a> from
occuring in results, prefix the term with a "-" character.<p>

<span class="query">surf -web</span><br>
This query finds documents that contain the term "surf" but excludes
those that also contain the term "web".  This would leave documents
about, for example, wind surfing and channel surfing in the result
set.<p>

<div class="mainHeader">And</div>
If the default operator is changed away to <a
href="operators.html#or">Or</a> (rather than <a
href="operators.html#and">And</a> or
<a href="operators.html#pand">Passage And</a>), a required term that
must be included in results may be specified with the prefix "+".<p>

<span class="query">+surf web</span><br>
In the case of OR being the default operator, this makes surf a required
term and leaves web as optional.  Documents containing both surf and
web are generally ranked higher.<p>

<div class="mainHeader">Phrase</div>
A <a href="operators.html#phrase">phrase</a> is a list of terms that
must occur in order with no intervening words.  Phrases may be specified
using quotation marks around the words of the phrase.<p>

<span class="query">"rock and roll"</span><br>
Finds documents that have the words "rock", "and", and "roll" in order
and with no words in between.  Since morphological expansion is used,
"rocking and rolling" would fit these criteria.<p>

<div class="mainHeader">Semantic Expansion</div>
To make use of Minion's semantic taxonomy features, the "~" character
may be used as a prefix to any term to invoke the <a
href="operators.html">EXPAND</a> term modifier.<p>

<span class="query">~dog</span><br>
Finds all documents with the term "dog" and also any terms subsumed by
dog in a taxonomy.  In an English taxonomy, this would mean that words
that were types of dog would be included such as "hound", "mutt",
"pooch", "canine", "greyhound", and "poodle".<p>

<div class="mainHeader">Passage</div>
If the default operator is changed from the passage operator, a list of
terms may be enclosed in "[" and "]" to be treated as a <a
href="operators.html#pand">passage</a>.<p>

<span class="query">[rock and roll] music</span><br>
Finds documents that contain "rock", "and", "roll", and optionally
"music" (assuming the default operator is OR).  Documents are ranked
according to the passage retrieval ranking algorithm in combination with
the weight of the term "music", when present.<p>
