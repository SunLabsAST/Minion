    <div class="pageHeader">Indexing with Minion</div>

    <p>
      Minion views a document as pairs of field names and field
      values.  For example, we can think of an email message as
      consisting of pairs of message header names (like
      <code>subject</code> or <code>sent-date</code>) and the values
      for those message headers.  We can treat the body of the message
      as an explicit <code>body</code> field.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are four related approaches to indexing with Minion.  In
      the first, an application passes individual field values
      one-by-one to the indexer until all the data for a document has
      been provided.  In the second, the application can construct a
      document by building a map from field names to the values for
      those fields for that document.  This map can then be passed to
      the search engine for indexing.  In the third approach, the
      search engine provides an interface that objects that you would
      like to index can implement.  Finally, the engine provides a
      document abstraction that can be used to index documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before you begin indexing data into fields, the application can
      define the fields that it wants to use.  The application can
      define fields at any time during indexing, but it's a good
      practice to define them before you start indexing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fields can be defined before-hand in the configuration file for
      your search engine or they can be defined in the indexing code
      itself.  Defining fields in your configuration file is covered
      in the <a href="configuration.html">configuration
        documentation.</a> You can define fields in your indexing code
      by using the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#defineField">SearchEngine.defineField</a>
      method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, if the engine encounters an unknown field name during
      indexing, a new field will be generated on-the-fly using a
      default set of attributes and types specified in the engine
      configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a separate document <a href="fields.html">describing
        the properties of fields</a> and what they mean.
    </p>

    <div class="mainHeader">Indexing with a Simple Indexer</div>

    <p>
      The <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html"><code>com.sun.labs.minion.SimpleIndexer</code></a>
      interface describes a method for indexing where each part of the
      document is provided separately.  An implementation of this
      interface can be gotten from the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#getSimpleIndexer"><code>SearchEngine.getSimpleIndexer</code></a>
      method.  The <code>SimpleIndexer</code> is sufficient for most
      indexing needs.
    </p>

    <div class="subHeader">Starting a Document</div>

    <p>
      Given a simple indexer, for each document an application wants
      to index, indexing begins with the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#startDocument"><code>SimpleIndexer.startDocument</code></a>
      method.  The application provides the key for the document to
      this method.  If the key matches the key of a document already
      in the index, then the data for the old document will be
      superseded by the new information, once the indexing is
      completed and the new data has been flushed to the disk.
    </p>

    <p>
      This method will throw an <code>IllegalStateException</code> if
      you attempt to start a document while you are in the middle of
      indexing another document.  It will throw a
      <code>SearchEngineException</code> if you try to use a
      <code>null</code> document key.
    </p>

    <div class="subHeader">Adding Field Values</div>

    <p>
The <a
      href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html"><code>SimpleIndexer</code></a>
      interface specifies a number of <code>addField</code> methods
      that can be used to add field value pairs to a document.  These
      methods take a field name and one of a variety of types for the
      field value.  The way that the field values are treated depends
      on the attributes and type of the fields into which they are
      being indexed.  The <a
      href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html">documentation
      for the <code>SimpleIndexer</code></a> contains information
      about how each <code>addField</code> method will be interpreted
      during indexing.
    </p>

    <p>
      An <code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown if an
      application attempts to use any of the <code>addField</code>
      methods before a document has been started using the  <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#startDocument"><code>startDocument</code></a>
        method.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>addField</code> methods can be called reapeatedly to
      add multiple values to a particular field.  For example, if a
      document has multiple authors, the <code>addField</code> method
      could be called once for each author, specifying the
      <code>author</code> field and the name of one of the authors.
      Of course, the <code>addField</code> methods that take a
      <code>java.util.Collection</code> or array of objects could be
      used for this purpose as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      For any of the <code>addField</code> methods, if a field name of
      <code>null</code> is passed into any of the
      <code>addField</code> methods, then the value will be added to
      the implicit body field for the document.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the name of an unknown field is passed into the engine, then
      a new field with that name will be defined on the fly.  The
      attributes that the field will have are dependent on the engine
      configuration, but the default is to make any unknown fields
      indexed, tokenized, and vectored, but not saved.
    </p>

    <div class="subHeader">Adding Terms</div>

    <p>
      In addition to the <code>addField</code> methods, the
      <code>SimpleIndexer</code> interface also specifies a number of
      <code>addTerm</code> methods that allow an application to add
      terms to the index one-by-one.  Terms can be added to the
      implicit body field or to an indexed field using one of the
      <code>addTerm</code> methods.  Additionally, counts for the
      terms can be specified so that <code>addTerm</code> does not
      need to be called repeatedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      An <code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown if an
      application attempts to use any of the <code>addTerm</code>
      methods before a document has been started using the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#startDocument"><code>startDocument</code></a>
        method.
    </p>

    <div class="subHeader">Ending a Document</div>

    <p>
      Once all of the data has been added to the document, the
      application should call <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#endDocument"><code>endDocument</code></a>
        to indicate that the document is done.  This method will throw
        an <code>IllegalStateException</code> if it is called when the
        <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#startDocument"><code>startDocument</code></a>
        method has not been called.
    </p>

    <div class="subHeader">Finishing Off</div>

    <p>
      Once an application has finished indexing documents with a
      <code>SimpleIndexer</code>, it <em>must</em> call the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#finish"><code>SimpleIndexer.finish</code></a>
        method.  Calling this method causes the in-memory data to be
        flushed out to the disk.  If an application does indexing with
      a <code>SimpleIndexer</code> but does not call the
      <code>finish</code> method, then some data may be lost when the
      search engine is shut down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once an application has called
      <code>SimpleIndexer.finish</code>, the
      <code>SimpleIndexer</code> cannot be used for any further
      indexing activity.  Any attempt to do so will result in an
      <code>IllegalStateException</code> being thrown.
    </p>

    <div class="mainHeader">Indexing Maps</div>

    <p>
      The <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#index(String,Map)">SearchEngine.index(String,Map)</a>
      method provides a way to index a map from field names to field
      values.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the search engine is passed a map for indexing, it will
      iterate through the entries in the map, processing each in turn.
      The keys in the entries are the names of the field into which we
      should index the values.  The valid values for the map being
      indexed are the same as those described above for the
      <code>SimpleIndexer.addField</code> methods.
    </p>


    <p>
      Note that if an application will need to do hit highlighting
      later on with the indexed documents, then the application should
      be using an implementation of <code>java.util.Map</code> whose
      iterators return the elements of the map in the order in which
      they were inserted.  We suggest using a
      <code>java.util.LinkedHashMap</code> for this purpose.
    </p>

    <div class="mainHeader">Indexing <code>Indexable</code>s</div>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/Indexable.html"><code>Indexable</code></a>
      interface is provided for the use of applications that would
      like to be able to pass their own objects into the search engine
      for indexing.  There are only two methods specified by the
      interface.  The first should return the unique key for the
      document represented by the <code>Indexable</code>.  The second
      method should return a map that is suitable for passing to the
      <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#index(String,Map)">SearchEngine.index(String,Map)</a>
        method described above.
    </p>

    <div class="mainHeader">Indexing Using a Document Abstraction</div>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/Document.html"><code>Document</code></a>
      interface defines a document abstraction that you can use to
      retrieve documents from the search engine and index documents.
      The abstraction gives access to the saved and vectored fields in
      the documents and allows the application to modify these fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can get an implementation of a <code>Document</code> using
      the <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#getDocument"><code>SearchEngine.getDocument</code></a>
        or <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#createDocument"><code>SearchEngine.createDocument</code></a>
        methods.  The first gets an existing document from the index,
        and the second creates a new document that is not currently indexed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the data in the document abstraction only represents
      the contents of fields that were vectored or saved.  Any data
      that was placed into the implicit body field in the document
      <strong>will not</strong> be part of the document abstraction
      returned by the search engine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the methods of the document interface, an application can
      add saved and vectored data to a document.  The  <a
        href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SearchEngine.html#index(Document)"><code>SearchEngine.indexDocument(Document)</code></a>
        method can then be used to index the document.  As with other
        indexing methods, if the document passed in is already in the
        index, the new data will replace the old data.  This method
        will not only index the data, but ensure that the data is
        flushed to the disk before it returns.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="javadoc/com/sun/labs/minion/SimpleIndexer.html#index(Document)"><code>SimpleIndexer.index(Document)</code></a>
      method can be used when an application wants to index a number
      of documents without flushing the data to disk after each
      document.
    </p>

    <p>
      The document abstraction is most useful in situations where all
      of the data in the documents will be stored in saved or vectored
      fields and where documents will be updated frequently.  For
      example, an application that builds up a document through the
      course of reading several different information sources might
      want to use the document abstraction to index each portion of
      the data as it becomes available.
    </p>

    <h1>What Happens During Indexing?</h1>

    <p>
      During indexing, all of the data indexed is stored in memory.
      When memory for the JVM begins to run low, indexing will stop
      and the data in memory will be dumped to the disk.
    </p>
